# Chapter 3
# Platforms and Ecosystems

When Johannes Gutenberg invented the printing press around 1440, he revolutionized the dissemination of ideas to the masses through books and other printed material. Today the global printing industry is worth over $800 billion, more than fifty times the size of the music industry. While digital printing is replacing offset printing and print volume is declining, shift to higher-value products has led to a growth in print revenues that is expected to continue until 2020.¹

Although printing technology has evolved in the last six centuries, the printing industry remains highly fragmented. Thousands of small and medium enterprises around the world buy printing machines, which can cost several million dollars apiece, to serve the needs of their local customers. Due to variability in customer demand, the majority of these machines are grossly underutilized. Globally, print capacity exceeds demand by a factor of six to one. Even with this large printing capacity, the process remains inefficient and costly for customers. Large multinational retailers often print the entirety of their catalog supply with a centralized printing company and then ship these catalogs to their stores around the world. However, this process is inefficient due

[Page 71]
to high shipping costs, the inability to produce localized content (e.g.,
catalogs in a local language), and oversupply of printed material, which
gets outdated quickly and is often discarded by the local stores.

Gelato, a startup based in Norway, decided to reinvent the print-
ing industry to solve the problems of buyers and suppliers by building
a platform that connects the two parties. Customers can upload their
print design on Gelato's cloud and order any quantity of the print mate-
rial to be delivered anywhere in the forty countries where Gelato cur-
rently operates. Gelato matches this demand with the unused capacity
of a supplier who is closest to the local delivery address. Since its incep-
tion in 2007, Gelato has grown rapidly and is cash-flow positive. Henrik
Müller-Hansen, its CEO and cofounder, has aspirations to make Gelato
into a multibillion-dollar company and, in the process, transform the
centuries-old printing industry.

## The Platform Revolution

Gelato is one of the many companies that are building platform-based
businesses to transform established industries. In recent years we have
witnessed the explosion of platform businesses that connect multiple
parties such as buyers and sellers (e.g., eBay), or consumers and devel-
opers (e.g., Apple's app store). Alibaba, Amazon's marketplace, and eBay
are all e-commerce platforms. Uber has revolutionized transportation by
connecting drivers with riders on its platform. Airbnb built a platform
to connect homeowners with travelers who need a place to stay. Upwork
connects businesses with freelancers who can perform a variety of tasks.

Why is there a sudden explosion of platforms? To understand this it
is useful to go back to 1776 when Adam Smith published his classic book
*The Wealth of Nations*. The main thesis of Smith's economic theory is that
people act in their own self-interest and that in a free market an invisi-
ble hand allocates resources efficiently. If the free market is supposed to
efficiently match workers with tasks, then why do firms exist? Why don't
we sell our skills in an open market instead of working for a company?

[Page 72]
In 1937, the economist Ronald Coase published a paper titled “The Nature of the Firm” to address this very question, a paper for which, in 1991, he received the Nobel Prize in economics. Coase argued that firms exist because of transaction costs. Simply put, it would be too difficult and costly for you to get up every morning and find a day's work that was suitable to your skill.

Today digital technology has dramatically reduced the transaction cost of finding and selling goods and services. Two decades ago it would have been hard for you to sell your old bike except in your immediate locale through a garage sale, but now internet-based platforms such as eBay allow buyers and sellers around the world to connect with one another, thereby reducing the transaction cost of selling (and buying) goods beyond your immediate locale. Similarly, platforms like Upwork reduce the transaction cost of freelancers seeking suitable work that doesn't require working for a company permanently.

## Advantages and Challenges of a Platform

Platforms provide unique advantages compared with traditional business models.

*   **Greater Access to Sellers.** The platform model works best in fragmented markets by aggregating dispersed supply and demand. This aggregation provides tremendous reach to suppliers, on a scale they could not imagine before. Jack Ma, the founder of Alibaba, recognized this opportunity in China when he said, “There are more than 40 million small businesses in China. Many of them operate in fragmented markets, with limited access to communication channels and information sources that would help them market and promote their products.”² This insight led to the creation of Alibaba, a platform that sells goods from millions of third-party suppliers.

*   **Better Value to Consumers.** Platforms also provide better value to consumers by offering them convenience and a greater variety of products and services at competitive prices, since a large

[Page 73]
number of suppliers compete for a buyer's business. A 2015 study of European consumers found that almost all of them (97 percent of internet users) derive significant value from online platforms.³ Through its platform Gelato's customers have seen a 90 percent reduction in transportation costs and a 50 percent reduction in paper waste.⁴

*   **Market Growth.** By lowering transaction costs, platforms open up whole new areas of supply and demand. Uber created a completely new supply of cars and drivers by reducing the transaction cost of finding riders, and riders' demand grew because of an increase in supply that made it easy to find a car on demand. Platforms also break down geographical barriers, greatly expanding the physical reach of both buyers and suppliers.

*   **Asset-light.** Platform businesses facilitate the transactions of third-party players without owning many assets. As indicated in chapter 2, an asset-light model lowers the capital requirement and allows for a business to rapidly expand. Gelato connects $300 million in print assets without owning a single printing machine.

*   **Scalability.** In addition to having a low capital requirement, platform businesses scale quickly due to network effects—more buyers on a platform attract more sellers, and more sellers in turn draw in more buyers. This creates a virtuous circle that often leads to a winner-take-all situation. Not surprisingly we see companies like Facebook, Uber, Alibaba, and Airbnb dominate and effectively become the standard in their markets.

*   **Innovation.** By attracting large numbers of sellers and developers, a platform creates an implicit incentive for them to innovate and improve their product and service to remain competitive. Research on crowdsourcing and open innovation also shows that—in contrast to dynamics within a company-led team—innovation is more likely to thrive in an environment where thousands or even millions of sellers or software developers are creating

[Page 74]
new products and services on a platform. Platforms also provide a
natural lab for these sellers to test new ideas and services.

In spite of these advantages, a company should carefully consider
some the challenges it may encounter as it moves to a platform model.
Flipkart, an e-commerce player in India valued at over $15 billion, illus-
trates these challenges.

In 2015, Flipkart decided to aggressively move from an inventory-
based model to a marketplace model where it would allow third-party
sellers to sell directly to consumers without Flipkart having to warehouse
any inventory. The company founders, Sachin and Binny Bansal, took
inspiration from Alibaba, Uber, and Airbnb, who demonstrated the effi-
cacy of this asset-light model.⁵ Uber does not own any cars, Airbnb does
not own any hotels, and Alibaba started without owning any products.
This lowers the fixed costs and capital investment of these companies
and improves their return on assets, and by extension the return on
equity. Low capital requirement also allows a company to rapidly scale.

However, not all companies have followed a similar model. Zappos,
an online shoe company acquired by Amazon, started as a marketplace
in 1999 but by the mid-2000s it had turned into a pure reseller by stock-
ing its inventory and taking full control of transactions. Amazon uses a
hybrid model in which third-party sellers account for about half of its
revenues. The remaining half comes from the sale of inventory man-
aged and stocked by Amazon itself.

Why do Zappos and Amazon want to hold inventory if a platform
offers scale and growth with limited capital investment? An inventory-
based model allows for greater control over product quality, delivery,
and availability and over customer service. This in turn leads to better
customer experience and enhanced customer loyalty. While a rating
system for third-party sellers can help weed out bad sellers, this system
is far from perfect. Alibaba started without owning any warehouses and
operated as a pure platform relying on third-party providers for logis-
tics. However, in 2013, Alibaba launched its logistics arm, Cainiao, with
a planned investment of $16 billion in the following five to eight years.⁶

[Page 75]
With this investment, Alibaba wanted to take better control of its
logistics, for faster delivery of products, and to avoid the problem of fake
and counterfeit products sold by third-party sellers, which had drawn
the ire of companies selling branded products.

In summary, a platform offers scale with low capital investment, but
it comes with limited control that may lead to poor customer experi-
ence. Companies that rely heavily on their platform spend enormous
amounts of time and effort managing customer experience.

## From Products to Platform

When we think of platforms, we typically think of marketplaces or ser-
vices like eBay or Uber, which connect buyers and sellers. Can compa-
nies that manufacture and sell products become platforms? In January
2014, Google paid $3.2 billion to buy Nest, a smart thermostat that
learns what temperature you like and automatically adjusts tempera-
ture in your house to save energy. But Google wasn't buying thermo-
stats, instead, it envisioned Nest becoming a platform on which many
applications could be developed for the connected home. In an effort
to attract developers to its platform, Nest launched the “Works with
Nest" program, and within a year the company had over 10,000 devel-
opers creating new applications. Nest also attracted large companies
that wanted to be a part of the connected home. Nest, the platform, now
works with Philips' smart LED bulbs, Whirlpool's washing machines,
and Xfinity Home security systems, among other products and services.
In the battle to own the home, Amazon created its own device, Echo
(a smart speaker that is connected to a voice-controlled personal assis-
tant service called Alexa), and Google responded by launching Google
Home. Tesla's car is nothing but software on wheels and could become
a platform for entertainment, payment, and much more.

As devices become embedded with sensors, their value is less in the
hardware itself and more in the interconnectedness of that hardware.
In the connected world, the battle is no longer fought among products.

[Page 76]
Instead, competitive advantage comes from building a platform that has an ecosystem around it. However, the journey from product to platform is not always easy or quick, and often a company's business model evolves over time to reach this stage. The digital journey of GE illustrates this transition.

## GE's Digital Journey and the Birth of the Predix Platform

Founded in 1892 in Schenectady, New York, GE is an industrial giant that operates in 180 countries, employs over 300,000 people, and generates more than $130 billion in revenue. The company manufactures complex industrial products such as wind turbines, jet engines, and locomotives. For over a hundred years, its strength and competitive advantage had been in its engineering, superior product design, and manufacturing.

In 2010, two facts became clear to Jeff Immelt, GE's CEO at the time. First, industrial productivity was expected to drop to less than 1 percent in the next decade, compared with 4 percent during the last decade.

Second, future improvements in productivity would come from software and analytics instead of physical improvements in products. Bill Ruh, CEO of GE Digital, emphasized this aspect, “Uber and Airbnb own no assets, yet they are valued more than auto manufacturers and hotels. It was clear to us that the future is not about who owns the assets but who makes those assets more productive.”7

Given this reality, GE was concerned about a new set of competitors. What if IBM, Google, or Amazon used their software and analytics capabilities to make GE assets more valuable to GE customers? Would they become the industrial version of Uber and extract all the value? GE could insert sensors into its jet engines and wind turbines to collect data, but could it be more competitive in software and analytics than IBM or Google?

[Page 77]
After much deliberation, GE management came up with the idea of
"digital twin," a combination of the physical model of, say, a jet engine
that allowed GE's engineers to forecast the failure probabilities of
various components over time; and the real-time operational data from
the sensors in an engine in use that could complement the theoretical
model of the engineers to more accurately predict failure and offer pre-
dictive maintenance. This deep knowledge not just of data and analytics
but of physics and engineering gave GE capabilities that IBM or Google
could not match effectively.

The question then became how digital twin and improved software
capabilities should change GE's business model. GE could develop soft-
ware and give it away for free with the capital equipment sales. This
would be consistent with GE's traditional hardware and product focus
and would require the least change to its business model. Alternatively,
GE could license the software as a separate product to generate addi-
tional revenue. A third option would be to deeply integrate GE's soft-
ware and analytical capabilities with customers' own data in order to
offer new outcome-based services. That last option could eventually
lead to building a platform, but it would require significant investments
and new capabilities.

Jeff Immelt decided to transform GE into an industrial digital com-
pany, and in 2011 he created GE Software, located in San Ramon,
California, and installed Bill Ruh as its head. As with most digital trans-
formations, this one evolved over time. During the transition, which was
marked by three distinct phases, GE Software changed from a center of
excellence to a stand-alone business unit, GE Digital, with over 30,000
people.

## Phase 1: GE for GE

GE started its digital journey to improve the productivity of its own
assets. Having been in business for more than a century, GE had a
very large installed base that provided it a unique competitive advan-
tage when launching this initiative. The goal was not simply to col-
lect data for the sake of data but to improve the productivity of assets.

[Page 78]
GE's analysis showed that a 1 percent efficiency gain could lead
to billions of incremental dollars for its customers. Digital twin and
asset-performance-management (APM) tools allowed GE to do predic-
tive maintenance, minimize downtime, and optimize assets, all of which
saved billions of dollars for its clients.

### Phase 2: GE for Customers
As the company developed in-house software and analytical capabilities to
improve the productivity of its assets, it decided to invite outside developers
to build apps for its cloud-based system, Predix, and also share these apps
with GE customers. Soon the company's relationship with its customers
transformed from selling products to selling outcome-based services. One
example of this is the GE Renewable Energy Group, which has an installed
base of 33,000 wind turbines around the world, almost one-third of all
turbines. For customers who bought GE turbines, the company started an
outcome-based system called “PowerUp.” As GE got data from sensors in
the turbines, it could make real-time changes—for example, changing the
pitch of a turbine blade if it got icy in cold weather. These changes have led
to as much as a 5 percent increase in annual energy production for some
of GE's clients, which translates into a 20 percent increase in their profits.
This productivity improvement is not limited to optimizing each turbine
individually. The location of turbines and the prevailing direction of wind
on a farm may warrant a farm-level optimization that is suboptimal for an
individual turbine but beneficial for the farm a whole.

A strong relationship with its customers is also helping GE develop
new services. For example, wind farms, who are GE's customers, are at
nature's mercy for the amount of energy they can generate on a given
day or in a given week. However, customers of wind farms—governments,
utility companies—expect the farms to deliver a certain amount of
energy. If a farm falls short, it has to buy energy in the spot market,
which can be very expensive. Using weather forecasts and historical
data from its turbines, GE Renewable can now forecast farms' power
production seven days ahead, allowing them to better manage their
power-generation business.

[Page 79]
**Phase 3: GE for the World**

In the next phase GE decided to open up its Predix platform to non-GE
customers. Bill Ruh explained GE's decision to become the platform for
industrial products: “There are lots of platforms optimized for consumer
Internet applications and consumer devices. There are some aimed at the
enterprise world, optimizing the IT environment. We saw nothing in the
industrial world.”⁸ Customers such as Pitney Bowes and Schindler started
using Predix and its analytical capabilities for their own clients. Roger
Pilc, executive vice president and chief innovation officer of Pitney Bowes,
explained his company's decision to use the Predix platform:

> We placed value with GE because they not only built the data
and analytics platform, but also because of the journey they've
been on for the last several years. They've been using data from
their own machines, doing the data analytics and then ultimately
evolving their own services organization in the exact same way as
us. That was an important element to us. We speak regularly not
just about the technology and the applications, but also about this
digital-industrial transformation.⁹

In his 2015 letter to shareholders, Jeff Immelt highlighted the impact
of GE's digital journey: “This year we will generate $500 million of
productivity by applying data and analytics inside GE. The revenue for
our analytical applications and software is $5 billion and growing 20%
annually . . . We are creating a $15 billion software and digital com-
pany inside of GE built on agile practices and new business models.”¹⁰

**Can Banks Become Platforms?**

In 2016, Goldman Sachs shocked the financial-services industry by
opening up its structured-notes business to competitors.¹¹ Structured

[Page 80]
notes, designed to help clients create highly customized risk-return
products, had been popular in Europe but had seen limited pene-
tration in the United States due to a highly fragmented market of
broker-dealers and a lack of education among them. Goldman Sachs
entered this market by creating its own product, called Structured
Investment Marketplace and Online Network (SIMON), which was built
on the company's "Marquee" platform.

The evolution of Goldman Sachs's digital journey followed a pattern
remarkably similar to that of GE. In a process championed by Goldman's
chief information officer at the time, R. Martin Chavez (who is now the
company's CFO), Goldman first embarked on creating internal efficiencies
across business units. Next, it opened up its Marquee platform to clients so
that they could use Goldman's proprietary database and tools to analyze
risk or construct their portfolio. One of the first tools available to clients
through application-program-interface (API) integration was SecDB, a
powerful database that calculated 23 billion prices across 2.8 million posi-
tions daily across 50,000 market scenarios. Giving clients access to SecDB,
which had long been considered Goldman's “secret sauce," puzzled the
market. However, by making these tools available to clients and by tightly
integrating Goldman's systems with those of its clients, Goldman hoped to
create stickiness and a unique competitive advantage.

SIMON started as an application on Marquee, and in the beginning
Goldman sold only its own products on SIMON. However, the company
soon realized the benefit of opening up its platform to competitors. Paul
Russo, the global co-chief operating officer of the equities franchise,
explained this decision: “We realized that growth of the single dealer
model had reached capacity. To continue to grow we need to add more
issuers. Clients also like competition. Having multiple issuers allows cli-
ents to mix and match credit risk against payoffs effectively."

Opening the platform to competition effectively increased the size
of the pie, and Goldman Sachs took a cut from the sale of competitors'
products on its platform. By 2016, Goldman's structured-note business
had grown to become the second-largest in the United States.

[Page 81]
Banks have traditionally been very product focused, and it may be
useful for them to rethink their business model. Francisco Gonzalez, the
group executive chairman of BBVA, the leading bank of Spain, has argued
that banks will have a hard time competing on products as those products
become less and less differentiated. Instead, an incumbent bank may want
to consider the benefits of creating a platform on which it provides its large
customer base access to its own and competitors' products. In the digital
age customers are likely to compare products anyway, and by providing
a central place for them to do so, the bank would benefit from getting a
portion of revenue if a competing product were sold on its platform.

## Developing a Platform Business

The GE and Goldman Sachs cases illustrate some of the issues in
transforming a product-focused company into a platform-based com-
pany. The goal of a product-focused company is to develop the best
product and maximize its sales and profits while ensuring competitive
advantage through tight control of proprietary knowledge. In con-
trast, a platform business creates value not simply by selling products
or services but by enabling transactions and by creating an entire eco-
system. Therefore, a platform-based business attempts to build a net-
work of third-party players who can develop complementary services;
designs its systems through APIs and tools to facilitate transactions;
often supports an open and shared system instead of a closed, pro-
prietary one; and develops mechanisms to manage partners who may
have conflicting interests. In the next part of this chapter we delve
deeper into some of the major challenges a company faces in building
a platform-based business.

## Building Critical Mass

Platforms enable transactions between multiple parties (e.g., buy-
ers and sellers), and companies often struggle on how to jump-start
the process-should they first focus on buyers (demand side of the

[Page 82]
platform) or the sellers (supply side of the platform)? Here are some
guidelines:

*   **Develop Compelling Applications or Services Yourself.** To jump-
    start the process, a firm needs to create a supply of good products
    and services first—after all, without anything to sell, it will be hard
    to attract potential buyers to the platform. In the early stages,
    when third-party sellers may be reluctant to join the platform,
    the firm has to build its own applications or create its own supply.
    Companies such as Microsoft and Sony-makers, respectively, of
    the Xbox and PlayStation gaming consoles—rely on the variety
    and scale of games produced by third-party developers. However,
    to attract these third-party developers to their platforms, they first
    developed a handful of engaging games themselves that attracted
    users, which in turn encouraged third-party developers to join
    these platforms. GE developed its own applications for its custom-
    ers before opening the Predix platform for outside developers
    and non-GE customers. Apple showed the power of its platform
    by building iTunes. Soon after acquiring Nest, Google acquired
    Dropcam, maker of a Wi-Fi enabled security camera that could
    be connected to Nest. This showed the power of the platform and
    attracted potential developers. Instead of starting with UberX or
    UberPOOL, in which users drive their own cars, Uber started its
    service with black cars driven by professional drivers. To jump-
    start its service, Airbnb used professional photographers to take
    pictures of apartments, which encouraged users to follow suit.¹²

*   **Start with a Focus.** Since platforms typically have strong network
    effects leading to winner-take-all markets, it is tempting to scale
    quickly by getting into multiple applications fast. However, at the
    early stage it is critical to develop a compelling use case and pow-
    erful customer experience by focusing on a small market to have a
    proof of concept. Uber started in January 2010 with a test in New
    York City and later launched the service in San Francisco in May
    2010. In the beginning, as mentioned, Uber used black cars driven

[Page 83]
by professional drivers. While clearly not scalable in the future,
this approach was designed to attract enough users to jump-start
the process and to ensure great customer experience, which even-
tually created strong word of mouth. Travis Kalanick, founder
of Uber, relied on users' word of mouth for early growth of the
company: "I'm talking old school word of mouth, you know at the
water cooler in the office, at a restaurant when you're paying the
bill, at a party with friends—'Who's Ubering home?' 95% of all our
riders have heard about Uber from other Uber riders."¹³ It took
Uber almost a year to test and refine its service in San Francisco
before going to a new city in California, Palo Alto. In the realm
of social media, even though it faced the dominant incumbent
MySpace, Facebook started by focusing only on Harvard students,
gradually expanding to more US and international students,
before ultimately opening up its platform to everyone. Reflecting
on the early growth stage of Flipkart, an Indian e-commerce com-
pany that started by selling books, cofounder Sachin Bansal noted,
“We were sure from the beginning that we would enter more cate-
gories. Initially we thought we would launch the next category in a
year. It took us three years to move beyond books.”¹⁴

*   **Subsidize One Side of the Platform.** When a company sells a
    product, it needs to charge each buyer in order to make money. In
    contrast, a platform connects multiple parties, and the company
    can afford to subsidize one side to stimulate demand while making
    profits on the other side. Research shows that the best approach is to
    subsidize the side of the platform that contributes more to demand
    for the other side.¹⁵ When Adobe introduced Acrobat software, it
    initially charged $35 to $50 for Acrobat Reader software and $195
    for the software to create PDFs. Later, to encourage adoption, it
    changed its approach and offered the Acrobat Reader for free.¹⁶

*   **Build a Freemium Model.** Platform businesses have strong net-
    work effects that can create a virtuous circle. To encourage
    adoption and create this network effect, many companies are

[Page 84]
beginning to adopt a freemium model in which a basic version of
the product is free for customers. Dropbox, Spotify, Pandora, and
*The New York Times* are examples of companies using such a strat-
egy. A freemium model has several benefits: For digital products,
the marginal cost of an additional customer is close to zero. A free
basic product encourages adoption and creates a large customer
base of users that generates strong network effects. And over time,
the use of a basic product encourages customers to upgrade to
paid premium products. However, designing freemium prod-
ucts and their pricing is a complex issue that requires careful
consideration.¹⁷

## Facilitating Access and Transactions

The primary function of a platform is to enable and facilitate transac-
tions. Recall that a platform business works by aggregating demand
from a fragmented market and by reducing transaction costs. There-
fore a platform owner needs to build tools and services to provide
easy access to third-party players on its platform, use algorithms to
match players on multiple sides of the platform, and offer additional
services that make it easy for them to do business. For example,
software platforms offer APIs to help developers build applications.
Facebook helped its users to find friends, which increased Facebook’s
value to users. Amazon offers warehousing and shipping services
to its marketplace sellers, which makes it easy for the sellers to do
business.

## Choosing between Open and Closed Systems

One of the main challenges for a company building a platform business
is the choice between an open, or shared, system and a closed, or pro-
prietary, system. An open system generally attracts a larger number of
independent players to the platform, which fosters greater innovation
and variety, builds more complementary products, lowers prices due to
competition among players, and creates a larger market. In contrast,
a company has more control with a closed system, which allows the

[Page 85]
company to create better integration and coordination across various
products and services offered on its platform, which in turn creates a
superior customer experience. A closed system also allows the platform
host to capture a larger share of the pie.

Google's Android is an open system, whereas Apple tightly controls
its iOS and carefully screens apps before approving them for its system.
As a result of these choices, Android enjoys a larger market share while
Apple provides a superior customer experience. In the second quarter
of 2017, Android had 87.7 percent of global market share compared
with 12.1 percent for Apple's iOS.¹⁸ In the credit- and debit-card mar-
ket, Mastercard and Visa have open systems in which they partner with
banks that ultimately issue cards to customers and acquire merchants.
In contrast, American Express manages a closed system in which it acts
as an issuing and acquiring bank as well as a processor of transactions.
In 2015, Visa accounted for 56 percent of all global card transactions,
followed by Mastercard, with its share of 26 percent. American Express
had a mere 3.2 percent share of all such transactions.¹⁹

For its in-car software, BMW opted to build an open system. Dr. Michael
Wuertenberger, the managing director of BMW's Car IT, explained:

> We definitely would like to have an open system. It will not be
> simply an Apple or a Google system inside the car. BMW has to
> work with both of them. Two years ago, we launched the first
> open-source in-car “infotainment” system that is Linux-based
> and can integrate with both Apple's and Google's software. We
> would like to share that system with other car makers to place
> into their vehicles. Openness is good.²⁰

The choice of an open or a closed system is not usually black and
white, as there are various parts of the platform that can be kept open
or proprietary.²¹ However, in general, an open system creates a larger
market and a closed system creates a better customer experience. So
the choice of an open or a closed platform depends on the goal and
strategy of the company. For example, Google, Apple, and Samsung

are creating open mobile-payment systems to build a large market. However, Starbucks created a very successful closed system for mobile payment that works only at Starbucks stores. Part of its success stems from enhancing customer experience by providing a compelling value proposition to its frequent visitors, who can order and pay ahead for their coffee, before they walk into a Starbucks store. (Figure 3-1 shows the growth of transactions on the Starbucks mobile-payment platform.)

## Managing Partners in the Ecosystem

Platforms develop an ecosystem of partners who provide complementary products and services. The word *ecosystem* was first coined in 1930 by British botanist Roy Clapham, and later popularized by ecologist Arthur Tansley to describe a community of organisms who, in conjunction with their environment, interact as a system.²² These organisms

[Page 87]
share resources, compete and collaborate, and co-evolve. This idea
was adapted for business by the writer James Moore in a 1993 *Harvard

Today, business ecosystems have become even more important as
technologies are increasingly blurring industry boundaries. “A vibrant
ecosystem can enable activities, assets, and capabilities to be flexible and
constantly reconfigured in response to the unexpected,” argue the writ-
ers Peter James Williamson and Arnoud De Meyer. “Both the demands
of consumers and the technologies available to satisfy them have
changed dramatically. Today’s world requires the capacity to deliver
complex solutions to customers, built by bringing together specialized
capabilities scattered in diverse organizations around the world.”²⁴
While the nineteenth and twentieth centuries focused on efficiency and
economies of scale, the current era requires coordination across a wide
variety of firms to provide complex and dynamic solutions to customers.

Deloitte, a consulting firm, defines business ecosystems as “dynamic
and co-evolving communities of diverse actors who create and capture
new value through both collaboration and competition.”²⁵ It is this
unique aspect of collaboration and competition among firms that makes
ecosystems unique and complex to manage.

Firms have varying degrees of control in this environment. For exam-
ple, Apple largely controls its iOS. Individual developers have limited
power. In contrast, Apple had significantly less power when it intro-
duced Apple Pay in partnership with banks and merchants and had to
carefully manage its relationship with these partners. In this complex

[Page 88]
environment, a company must understand the motivations of its part-
ners in order to manage the ecosystem effectively. The launch of Apple
Pay illustrates this complexity.

In September 2014, Tim Cook, Apple's CEO, announced the launch
of Apple Pay and said, “Our vision is to replace this [wallet], and we are
going to start with payments."26 Apple did not blow up the existing pay-
ment system. Instead, it decided to work within the current payments
ecosystem. Jennifer Bailey, vice president of Apple Pay, explained this
decision:

> We want to support what people already use and love. Consum-
> ers are already comfortable using their credit and debit cards
> that are supported by the majority of merchants and banks.
> Banks are good at what they do: they are good at credit, brand-
> ing, customer service and conducting payments. Apple's role was
> simply to bring together the hardware, software and services to
> create the experience on the phone. 27

This choice led Apple to work with its partners: the banks, the
merchants, and the payment networks (Mastercard, Visa, American
Express). While each of these partners collaborated with Apple, they
were also considering launching their own mobile-payment systems.
Soon after the launch of Apple Pay, some of the largest US merchants
launched Merchant Customer Exchange (MCX), Chase created its
own mobile-payment system called Chase Pay, Mastercard started
Masterpass, and Visa introduced Visa Checkout as its online and
mobile-payment system. In this collaboration the key battle is for the
control of customers. Banks don't want Apple to own the user interface
and effectively become a utility in the background, yet they can't ignore
Apple either, because of Apple's strong affinity among consumers.

A similar battle for the customer is brewing in the automotive ecosys-
tem, and the participants include incumbent auto manufacturers like
GM, Ford, and BMW; new players like Tesla; technology companies like
Apple and Google, which are developing in-car technologies such as

CarPlay; and telecommunication companies like Verizon, Vodaphone, and Telefónica, which are vying for a position in the era of connected cars (see figure 3-2).

Reflecting on Mercedes-Benz's strategy, Wilko Stark, vice president of Daimler's group strategy, product strategy, and product planning, noted:

> The company that has access to the customer interface is the one who possesses the opportunity to do one-to-one marketing and personalized services for each customer through the data that is collected. We already know a lot about each of our customers, where they drive, what is their location—we want to offer them personalized services as well.²⁸

There is no easy solution for managing these complex partnerships. Players need to understand the motivations of their partners and care- fully balance their own interests with those geared to the success of the overall ecosystem. For instance, even though Apple and Google launched competing mobile-payment systems, they have very different motivations. Apple's business is largely driven by hardware, so its moti- vation is primarily to create complementary services for the iPhone,

[Page 90]
while Google's business depends on advertising and data. Not surpris-
ingly, in launching Apple Pay, Apple decided that banks and merchants,
not Apple, would own the data. In contrast, Google needs mobile-
payment data to close the loop from search to purchase to show the
effectiveness of its advertising.

## Governance
In 2016, Facebook was blamed for influencing the US presidential elec-
tion by not identifying fake news stories on its site, many of which went
viral. Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook's founder and CEO, described these
allegations as crazy. After all, Facebook is an open social platform where
people are free to express their opinions without any effort by Facebook
to tilt the conversations one way or the other. In a November 12, 2016,
Facebook post, Zuckerberg said,

> Of all the content on Facebook, more than 99% of what peo-
ple see is authentic. Only a very small amount is fake news and
hoaxes. The hoaxes that do exist are not limited to one partisan
view, or even to politics. Overall, this makes it extremely unlikely
hoaxes changed the outcome of this election in one direction or
the other.²⁹

However, this did not satisfy the critics, who argued that Facebook
has a large influence on social conversations and therefore has a respon-
sibility, like a media company, to separate the truth from hoaxes. Using
technology and users' input, Facebook is now trying to identify and
curb fake news. In early 2018, Facebook again faced strong criticism
for failing to protect consumer data as the news broke that a UK-based
company, Cambridge Analytica, used consumers' Facebook data to tar-
get political ads to influence the 2016 US presidential elections.

To avoid market failures, platform owners need a governance system
to create rules by which various players operate within its ecosystem—
whether it is to limit fake news and pornography on Facebook while still
encouraging free and open conversations or to delist sellers with bad

[Page 91]
customer service on Amazon’s marketplace while still trying to increase the number of sellers. Insights from diverse corners—such as corporate governance in finance and accounting, laws governing interactions among nation-states, and research on the proper function of the kidney exchange—can provide guidance on how to govern and manage a platform business.

Based on his research on the medical labor market and the kidney exchange, Alvin Roth, winner of the 2012 Nobel Prize in economics, said, “Traditional economics views markets as simply the confluence of supply and demand. A new field of economics, known as ‘market design,’ recognizes that well-functioning markets depend on detailed rules.”³⁰ He went on to explain three things that are needed for markets to function properly: Markets or platforms need to provide thickness, which brings large numbers of buyers and sellers together. They need to make it *safe* for participants to reveal and act on confidential information they may hold. And they need to manage congestion, or competition and complexity, that arises from thickness.

In conclusion, platforms provide a new way of conducting business that warrants an outside-in perspective, meaning that firms need to open up their systems in order to collaborate and partner with many players, some of whom may even be their competitors. And this requires new skills and capabilities to manage and govern a platform.
