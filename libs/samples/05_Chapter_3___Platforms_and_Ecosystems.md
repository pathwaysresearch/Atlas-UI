MODULE 1 — Disruptive Innovation
Learning objectives
By the end of this module, the learner can:
1. Diagnose whether an insurance market change is disruptive vs sustaining vs efficiency
innovation.
2. Explain why strong incumbents often rationally ignore early disruptors — and what
signals they misread.
3. Identify the technology conditions that make disruption and new business models
possible — and translate them into an actionable client agenda.
Sub-Module 1.1 — What “Disruption” Means
Instructional content
In digital transformation conversations, “disruption” is often used as a synonym for “big change.”
That’s a problem, because it leads to two costly errors:
● Error 1: Overreacting — treating every fintech/insurtech headline as existential,
triggering scattered investments and “innovation theater.”
● Error 2: Underreacting — assuming disruption can be handled with a feature upgrade,
when the real threat is a different business model that changes who the customer is,
what “good” looks like, and how money is made.
To advise well, you need a precise working definition:
Disruption is a process where a new player starts by serving customers the incumbent is
structurally disincentivized to prioritize — then improves over time and moves into the
mainstream. Early on, it often looks unimpressive by the incumbent’s standards.
This definition matters because it forces a question that changes the entire client agenda:
Where is the entrant starting — and why is the incumbent happy to ignore that segment?
Disruption usually starts from one of two footholds.
1) Low-end foothold: “Overserved” customers + a cheaper, simpler offer

A low-end disruption begins when incumbents have pushed performance (features,
customization, service levels) beyond what a portion of the market truly values. Those
customers are overserved: they’re paying for complexity they don’t fully need.
In insurance, overserving can appear as:
● Highly complex products with layers of riders/endorsements that a segment doesn’t use
● Service models designed for large accounts applied to smaller accounts
● Cost structures (distribution + servicing + compliance overhead) that make smaller
segments unattractive
A low-end disruptor doesn’t try to beat incumbents on “maximum coverage sophistication.” It
competes by redefining what “good enough” means for a segment that is tired of paying for the
premium experience.
What the disruptor wins on initially:
● Simplicity (buying and understanding)
● Lower price (or lower total cost of ownership)
● Convenience (less friction)
● A cost structure that can profit at lower price points
As a Client Director, your diagnostic isn’t “Is it a worse product?” (it often is, at first). Your
diagnostic is: Is it a product that’s better matched to what a low-end segment values, at
economics that the incumbent can’t easily match without hurting its own model?
2) New-market foothold: turning non-consumers into consumers
A new-market disruption doesn’t start by stealing customers from incumbents. It starts by
making it possible for people who weren’t buying insurance at all (or couldn’t meaningfully
access it) to begin buying.
In insurance, “nonconsumption” can mean:
● Customers who are uninsured because the product is too complex or intimidating
● Customers for whom the distribution model never reached them (high acquisition cost)
● Customers who rely on informal substitutes (self-insurance, informal community support)
● Micro-entrepreneurs who don’t fit underwriting boxes
A new-market disruptor succeeds when it turns “insurance is not for me” into “I can actually get
this.”
This is why many disruptive plays look small and unattractive to incumbents at the start: they
are creating demand where incumbents didn’t see profitable demand.
What disruption is NOT
To keep your client advice crisp, distinguish disruption from two other innovation types that
matter but require different responses:
Sustaining innovation
This is what most incumbents do well: improving products and services for existing customers
along existing performance metrics. In insurance, think: better risk selection, faster claims
settlement, more personalized pricing for the same mainstream segments.
Sustaining innovation can be strategically important — but it usually doesn’t change the game’s
rules.
Efficiency innovation

This is innovation that reduces cost or improves productivity without fundamentally changing the
value proposition. In insurance, think: automating back-office workflows, modernizing core
systems, reducing cycle times.
Efficiency innovation helps margins and speed, but it typically won’t defend against a disruptive
business model that changes market structure.
The implication: how to guide the conversation
When a client says, “We’re being disrupted,” you can turn that into a disciplined advisory
sequence:
1. Identify the foothold. Low-end overserving or new-market nonconsumption?
2. Ask what the entrant is optimizing for. Simplicity? Convenience? A different
distribution channel? A different cost structure?
3. Define the migration pathway. How would they improve over time and move
upmarket?
4. Decide the appropriate response type. (We’ll later cover responses in Module 3, but
the point here is: don’t choose a response before you diagnose the phenomenon.)
Key Insight:
If you can’t clearly articulate the foothold and the “move upmarket” pathway, you may be looking
at a competitor — but not a disruption pattern.
Common Pitfall:
Calling something disruptive because it uses digital tech. Digital enables many things; disruption
is a specific trajectory of market entry and expansion.

Bridging to 1.2:
Now that you can define disruption precisely, the next question is the one clients ask with
genuine confusion: “If we’re smart and well-resourced, why wouldn’t we respond early?” The
answer is not “bad leadership.” It’s the logic of incentives and performance trajectories.
Sub-Module 1.2 — Why Incumbents Ignore Early Disruptors

Instructional content (learner-facing)
Executives often assume that if disruption is real, incumbents should react early — and if they
don’t, it must be a failure of leadership. That’s rarely true.
The deeper explanation is that established companies are built to do a specific job extremely
well: allocate resources toward opportunities that match their current customers, margin
expectations, and performance metrics.Disruption is threatening precisely because it starts in
places that don’t pass those filters.
Let’s break the logic into two parts you can use directly in client conversations.
Part 1: Performance trajectories — how incumbents “overshoot” customer needs
Over time, incumbents improve offerings. The result is a rising “performance trajectory.” In many
industries, that eventually leads to overserving: offerings become more complex and costly
than a segment needs.
In insurance, overserving shows up in a familiar pattern:
● Complex products designed for high-end needs become the default
● Underwriting and servicing processes optimize for risk control and compliance, but
create friction
● Distribution models (brokers/agents, call centers) carry significant cost structures
● Premium increases and complexity feel unavoidable — until someone offers a simpler
alternative
Part 2: Asymmetric motivation — why ignoring is rational
Now comes the core reason incumbents ignore early disruptors: asymmetric motivation.

● Incumbents are motivated to chase the most profitable customers and opportunities.
● Early disruptive footholds (low-end or new markets) are often lower margin, smaller, and
uncertain.
● So the incumbent’s best people and capital flow toward sustaining innovations —
because that is what the system rewards.
Even when leaders intellectually acknowledge a new entrant, the organization struggles to
respond because:
● The disruptive opportunity doesn’t look attractive compared with “sure thing” investments
in the core
● The disruptive model may cannibalize the core’s margin or channel relationships
● The KPIs used to judge success are mismatched (e.g., growth and learning vs margin
and scale)
This is why disruptors often “win by being ignored.” Incumbents don’t lose because they can’t
innovate; they lose because their innovation system is tuned for a different game.
How this changes your advisory stance
When advising an insurer, your job is to shift the conversation from blame to design:
● Don’t ask: “Why didn’t you respond?”
● Ask: “What conditions would have made responding rational inside your current
incentive system?”
That leads to practical actions:
● Build separate evaluation metrics for early-stage disruptive bets (learning velocity,
adoption in foothold segment, unit economics trajectory)
● Ring-fence channels and pricing experiments so the core doesn’t veto them
● Explicitly decide what you are willing to cannibalize and what you are not
Key Insight:
When a client says “we should have seen it coming,” you can respond: “You likely did see it —
but the opportunity couldn’t compete internally with core investments. The solution is not better
forecasting; it’s governance and metrics that allow exploration.”
Common Pitfall:
Treating a mainstream pilot as proof you’ve “handled disruption.” If the disruptive threat is a
different cost structure or distribution model, a pilot inside the old model may not meaningfully
address it.

Module Summary (~200 words)
Disruption is not “any big digital change.” It’s a specific market process: a new player starts in a
low-end foothold (overserved customers) or a new-market foothold (nonconsumers), where
incumbents are structurally disincentivized to compete. Early on, the entrant often looks inferior
on mainstream metrics — which is why disruption is frequently missed until later stages.
Incumbents don’t ignore disruption because they’re irrational; they ignore it because their
incentives, metrics, and resource allocation systems are optimized for sustaining innovations
that serve core profitable customers. In insurance, this logic is amplified by cost structures,
distribution models, and product complexity that can overserve some segments while leaving
others unserved. Digital disruption accelerates when three technology forces work together:
digitization makes information cheap and analyzable, computing makes advanced decisioning
scalable, and modularity enables ecosystems and rapid recombination through interoperable
components. As a Client Director, your advantage is diagnostic clarity: identify the foothold,
explain the incentive logic, and translate the three forces into a concrete client agenda of signals
to capture, decisions to automate/assist, and ecosystem pathways to enable.
MODULE 2 — Platform Business Models: How Insurance Value Shifts from “Pipeline” to
“Network”
Learning objectives (what the learner can DO after this module)
By the end of this module, the learner can:
1. Differentiate pipeline vs platform models and identify when insurance economics start
behaving like a network.
2. Design an early platform “go-to-market” sequence that solves the chicken-and-egg
problem using subsidies and sequencing.
3. Assess platform competitive dynamics using mono-homing vs multi-homing, switching
costs, and envelopment-style moves.
Context lens: A Nagarro Client Director advising insurers, brokers, MGAs, insurtech partners,
and ecosystem players.

Sub-Module 2.1 — Platforms vs Pipelines in Insurance: The Moment Economics Changes
Instructional content (learner-facing)
Most incumbents in insurance operate as pipelines: they source risk, price it, acquire
customers through channels, and manage claims. Value flows in a relatively linear way: inputs
→ underwriting → policy → claims → renewal. The organizational reflex is also linear: optimize
conversion, optimize loss ratio, optimize claims leakage, optimize retention.
A platform flips the center of gravity. Instead of mainly producing a product and selling it, the
platform orchestrates interactions among participants who benefit from each other. The
platform’s value is created in the network—through matching, rules, trust, data exchange, and
governance.
That’s not semantics. It changes three critical things that matter to your advisory role:
1. Where value is created (inside the firm vs across an ecosystem)
2. How advantage scales (supply-side scale vs demand-side network effects)
3. How competition works (products compete on features; platforms compete on network
dynamics and “who owns the interaction”)
A practical way to spot a platform opportunity in insurance
When advising clients, look for situations where:
● One group wants access to another group (and vice versa)
● There’s friction in matching (search, trust, verification, paperwork, coordination)
● A shared set of rules and data would reduce friction for everyone
● More participation makes the experience better for the next participant
That last point is important: platforms can benefit from network effects—where the value to
one participant increases as more participants join.
Insurance examples where platform logic can emerge

● Claims ecosystem orchestration: policyholders, repair shops, adjusters, parts
suppliers, fraud detection providers
○ If the insurer is merely paying claims, it’s a pipeline.
○ If the insurer is orchestrating a network where better repair partners reduce cycle
time and fraud, and more participants improve matching quality, it starts
behaving like a platform.

● Risk prevention networks: customers, IoT providers, building managers, health
providers, emergency services
○ Value shifts from “pay when bad things happen” to “prevent bad things from
happening,” and coordination becomes the product.

● Embedded insurance distribution ecosystems: merchants, fintechs, mobility
providers, travel aggregators, insurers
○ The “product” may become a modular component; the platform is the distribution
and data relationship.

Pipeline scale vs platform scale (why boards care)
A pipeline scales with supply-side economies: if you do more volume, your unit costs decline
(operations, procurement, leverage in reinsurance, etc.). Platforms can also have operational
scale, but their distinctive scaling force is demand-side economies—network effects.
Here’s the advisory implication: many insurance leaders assume scale comes from writing more
premiums and spreading costs. That is pipeline thinking. Platform thinking asks: “Does
increased participation change the value proposition itself?” If yes, then growth is not just “more
volume,” it’s potentially a compounding advantage.
Two-sided (or multi-sided) networks in insurance
Many platforms are two-sided: they serve two participant groups who need each other, and the
platform sits in the middle.
In insurance, “two sides” might be:
● Policyholders ↔ repair networks
● Customers ↔ risk-prevention services
● Distribution partners ↔ insurers
● SMEs ↔ insurers/reinsurers (via underwriting data partners)
The important mental model is that value can be created through cross-side effects: more of
one side makes the platform more valuable to the other side.
Common Pitfall:
Leaders often say “we have a platform” when they mean “we have an app.” An app is an
interface. A platform is an interaction system with participants, governance, and scalable
network value.
Key Insight:
In a platform model, the most strategic asset is often not the product; it’s the interaction and
data loop the platform orchestrates.

Bridging to 2.2:
Once you see the platform opportunity, the hardest part is not strategy slides—it’s the practical
launch challenge: without participants on both sides, there’s no value. Next we’ll tackle the
chicken-and-egg problem and how to use subsidies and sequencing to get the network moving.
Sub-Module 2.2 — Mobilizing The Network: How Insurance Platforms Actually Launch
Instructional content (learner-facing)

Platforms don’t fail because the concept is wrong; they fail because the early network has no
reason to exist yet. In insurance, this is amplified by trust, regulation, and operational
complexity. Early-stage platforms face a classic dynamic:
● Side A won’t join because Side B isn’t there.
● Side B won’t join because Side A isn’t there.
● The platform has no value until both participate.
This is the chicken-and-egg problem. Your advisory value is helping clients avoid two traps:
● Trap 1: “Build it and they will come.”
● Trap 2: “Let’s onboard everyone.” That creates operational chaos without proving the
network logic.
Instead, successful platform launches are designed around sequencing and subsidy logic.
Step 1: Identify your “value-creating side” and your “value-capturing side”
A useful platform heuristic is: one side is typically more sensitive to participation than the other.
Often:
● One side creates the core value (quality, selection, reliability, coverage, trust)
● The other side is willing to pay (directly or indirectly) once that value exists
In insurance ecosystems, “who pays” is not always literal payment. Sometimes the platform is
monetized through:
● Lower claims costs and leakage reduction
● Higher retention due to better experience
● Distribution partners paying for access or conversion
● Data services and underwriting lift (within governance constraints)
Step 2: Decide subsidy vs money side
A platform often subsidizes the side that is most critical to attract the other side—because
bringing them in increases total network value.
In an insurance claims platform:
● Subsize repair partners? You might give them guaranteed volume, faster payments,
tools, or reduced admin costs.
● Subsidize policyholders? You might offer a superior experience, transparent pricing,
faster settlements, or proactive services.
The key is to treat subsidy as an investment in network formation, not as “discounting.”
Key Insight:
Subsidies are not about generosity, you spend where it unlocks value for the entire network.
Step 3: Choose a sequencing strategy that creates “local density”
A common platform mistake is launching too broadly. Platforms don’t need “everyone”; they
need enough participants in a focused context that interactions actually happen. Think of it as
achieving local density.
In insurance, that might mean:
● A single line (e.g., motor claims)

● A single geography (e.g., one city)
● A single segment (e.g., SME fleet policies)
● A single use case (e.g., windshield repairs, water damage remediation)
Why? Because early trust, service quality, and repeatable interactions matter. Local density
creates visible value and learnable economics.
Step 4: Design rules and governance early
Insurance platforms operate in a trust- and compliance-heavy environment. That means
governance isn’t a “later” problem. It’s part of the product.
Early governance design typically includes:
● Eligibility rules (who can participate)
● Service-level expectations (what qualifies as “good”)
● Data-sharing rules (what data flows, with consent and security)
● Dispute resolution mechanisms
● Quality control and fraud prevention measures
These rules reduce friction and increase trust—two of the main reasons platforms exist in the
first place.
Common Pitfall:
Assuming network growth automatically increases value. In insurance ecosystems, growth
without governance can increase fraud, reduce service quality, and create negative network
effects (the experience becomes worse as more participants join).
Step 5: Measure what matters early
Early platform metrics are usually misunderstood. A pipeline mindset asks: “How much premium
did we write?” A platform mindset asks:
● Are interactions happening (match rate, completion rate)?
● Is quality improving (cycle time, satisfaction, rework rates)?
● Is the network becoming more self-sustaining (repeat usage, partner retention)?
● Are unit economics moving in the right direction?
This is where you help the client avoid premature scaling. A platform can look “small” at first but
be structurally compounding.

Bridging to 2.3:
Even if you launch well, platforms compete differently than pipelines. The next step is
understanding when markets tip toward one dominant player, when multi-homing keeps
competition open, and how platform envelopment can reshape insurance ecosystems.
Sub-Module 2.3 — Platform Competition in Insurance: Homing, Switching Costs, and
Envelopment

Instructional content (learner-facing)
In pipeline businesses, competition is usually framed around product differentiation, brand,
distribution reach, and cost efficiency. In platform businesses, competition is often about who
owns the participant relationships and which network becomes the most attractive place for
interactions.
Three concepts help you advise insurance clients with clarity: homing/multi-homing,
switching costs, and envelopment.
1) Homing and multi-homing: do participants commit or diversify?

“Homing” describes whether participants stick to one platform (single-home / mono-home) or
use multiple platforms simultaneously (multi-home).
In insurance ecosystems:
● A repair shop might join multiple insurer networks (multi-home) to maximize job flow.
● A customer might be on multiple embedded insurance ecosystems without realizing it
(multi-home across journeys).
● A distribution partner might integrate with multiple carriers (multi-home) to maximize
choice.
Why it matters:
If both sides can multi-home easily, competition stays open. If one or both sides tend to single-
home, the market can “tip” toward a dominant platform.
2) Switching costs: what makes leaving hard (or easy)?
Switching costs are the friction—financial, operational, psychological, or contractual—that make
it hard to move from one platform to another.
In insurance, switching costs can come from:
● Deep integrations (APIs and workflows embedded in partner systems)
● Data and learning advantages (risk models improve with usage; fraud detection
improves with network history)
● Trust and service reliability (participants prefer what is predictable)
● Contractual arrangements and exclusivity (direct or indirect)
Your job is to help clients see that “owning the platform” is not just about being first—it’s about
creating switching costs ethically and sustainably, often through superior governance and
participant value.
Common Pitfall:
Assuming switching costs are always good. In regulated and trust-based environments, “locking
in” participants without improving value can backfire through regulation, reputation, and partner
resistance.
3) Winner-take-all vs contested markets: the realistic platform question
Leaders often assume platforms naturally become monopolies. The reality is conditional. A
market tends toward “winner-take-all” when:
● Network effects are strong and reinforce one dominant player
● Multi-homing is difficult or undesirable
● There is not enough scope for differentiation
Insurance ecosystems sometimes meet these conditions locally (e.g., a dominant claims
network in a region), but often remain contested because multi-homing is feasible for partners
and regulation/interoperability pressures reduce lock-in.
So your job is not to predict monopoly; it’s to diagnose the likely structure and advise
accordingly:
● If multi-homing is easy, focus on differentiation, governance, and partnership strategy.
● If single-homing is likely, focus on rapid density-building and defensible participant value.
4) Platform envelopment: how adjacent platforms invade insurance value chains

Envelopment is when a platform with an existing user base enters another platform’s space by
bundling its own platform with overlapping participants, often making adoption easy because the
relationship already exists.
In insurance, envelopment is a real strategic threat/opportunity:
● A large payments or commerce platform can embed insurance because it already owns
the customer transaction context.
● A mobility platform can offer insurance because it already owns usage data and
customer engagement.
● A health ecosystem platform can offer protection products because it already owns
preventive services and engagement loops.
The core insight is: disruption may not come from an insurer at all. It may come from a platform
that controls a high-frequency customer interaction and can “wrap” insurance into it.
Key Insight:
In platform competition, the most strategic question is often: Who owns the customer’s
moment of need? Insurance products attach themselves to moments: buying, traveling,
driving, shipping, building, operating.
Defensive playbook (how incumbents respond as platforms emerge)
When advising insurers, you can outline response choices such as:
● Build your own ecosystem where you have a natural advantage (claims excellence, risk
expertise, trust)
● Partner with the enveloping platform (be the risk capacity + product engine)
● Focus on a niche where governance and risk expertise matter more than distribution
reach
● Reconfigure business models and alliances to avoid being “commoditized capacity”
(We’ll go deeper on incumbent responses in Module 3; here the point is to recognize the
competitive dynamics early.)


Module Summary (~200 words)
A pipeline insurer creates value mainly inside the firm: underwriting, pricing, servicing, and
claims. A platform creates value by orchestrating interactions across participants—customers,
partners, service providers, and data ecosystems—where participation itself can increase value
through network effects. Platform strategy is not “build an app”; it’s designing rules, trust, data
flows, and governance that make interactions easier and better as the network grows. The
hardest platform challenge is chicken-and-egg: without participants on both sides, there’s no
value. The practical solution is sequencing and subsidies—building local density in a focused
use case or geography, subsidizing the side that unlocks participation, and measuring
interaction quality (not just revenue) early. Platform competition is shaped by multi-homing vs
single-homing, switching costs, and envelopment—where adjacent platforms with existing
relationships bundle insurance into their ecosystems. For an insurance Client Director, this
module provides a disciplined advisory lens: identify when platform economics apply, design a
network launch plan, and anticipate competitive dynamics that can reshape who controls
distribution and the customer’s moment of need.
MODULE 3 — Incumbent Response: How Insurers Should Respond When Business
Models Shift
Learning objectives
By the end of this module, the learner can:

1. Recommend an incumbent response strategy (fight back / double down / retrench /
move away) based on disruption + platform dynamics in insurance.
2. Design an execution approach using an “incubate → separate → integrate/morph” logic
that protects the new model while leveraging the core.
3. Advise leaders on the “transformation trough”: how market expectations and internal
incentives can punish the transition before benefits arrive—and what to do about it.
Sub-Module 3.1 — The Transformation Arc for Insurers

Instructional content (learner-facing)
When an incumbent insurer sees disruption or platform-based threats, leadership often swings
between two extremes:
● Extreme 1: Denial — “We have brand, capital, distribution, and regulators. We’ll be
fine.”
● Extreme 2: Overcorrection — “We must become a platform immediately,” leading to
expensive programs that collide with legacy processes, channels, and financial
expectations.
A more realistic (and client-coachable) approach is a staged transformation arc. Think of it as
three horizons—each building on the last. This arc is inspired by how large incumbents have
tried to digitize and platform-enable themselves: start by extracting value from the installed
base, then shift toward outcomes, then open ecosystems.
We’ll anchor this in an insurance example that is structurally similar to what you see in other
industrial incumbents that attempted “digital transformation at scale.”

Horizon 1: “Insurance for Insurance” — monetize the installed base through productivity
and control
Incumbent insurers have a built-in advantage: an installed base of customers, policies, claims
histories, provider relationships, and regulatory licenses. But that advantage doesn’t
automatically translate into digital advantage unless it becomes measurable operational
performance.
In this horizon, the primary goal is productivity and loss performance—not “innovation
theater.” Practical moves include:
● Digitizing claims evidence and workflow to reduce cycle time and leakage
● Improving fraud detection and subrogation success using better data signals
● Standardizing and modularizing core processes so they can be reused across lines and
geographies
● Turning underwriting and claims into repeatable “decision systems” rather than bespoke
art
Why this horizon matters: it generates the cash, credibility, and operational foundation that
later horizons require. It also creates the first real “digital assets”: clean data flows, reusable
components, and a measurable operating model.
In Your Context (advising a CEO):
Your message is: “Before we try to ‘be a platform,’ we should prove we can run the core as a
modern, modular decision factory—otherwise any ecosystem ambition will collapse under
execution debt.”
Common Pitfall:
Treating Horizon 1 as a pure IT modernization project. If it doesn’t connect to business
outcomes (loss ratio, cycle time, fraud leakage, retention), it won’t sustain executive attention.
Horizon 2: “Insurance for Customers” — shift from paying claims to improving outcomes
Once the core is more digitized and data-driven, an insurer can start delivering outcome-based
value, not just risk transfer. This is where the business model starts shifting.
In insurance, outcomes often mean:
● Faster recovery (claims cycle time and repair quality)
● Reduced incidents (prevention and risk management)
● Less hassle (frictionless onboarding, transparent coverage, proactive guidance)
This horizon is where insurers often introduce services that feel less like “insurance” and more
like “risk + resilience.” For example:
● A commercial property insurer providing risk monitoring and maintenance
recommendations to reduce water damage losses
● A motor insurer partnering to deliver faster repairs and better customer experience
● A cyber insurer offering preventive controls and incident response coordination
Why this horizon matters: it redefines the insurer’s role in the customer’s life. Instead of “a
company you call when something goes wrong,” the insurer becomes a partner in avoiding or
reducing harm.
Key Insight:

Outcome-based moves are often the bridge between pipelines and platforms. They create
repeated interactions and data loops—critical ingredients for platform dynamics.
Horizon 3: “Insurance for the Ecosystem” — platform enablement and opening the
system
Only after the insurer has (a) modernized the core and (b) built outcome-oriented services does
“platform enablement” become credible.
This horizon is about building an ecosystem where:
● The insurer can orchestrate interactions among customers, partners, service providers,
and data sources
● The insurer exposes capabilities (e.g., underwriting APIs, claims routing, risk scoring
services) in modular form
● Partners can innovate on top of the insurer’s capabilities without the insurer building
everything
But “platform” here isn’t the goal; it’s the mechanism for scaling outcomes.
In practical insurance terms, platform enablement might look like:
● An ecosystem marketplace of vetted repair and remediation providers
● An embedded insurance partner hub with standardized integration, pricing guardrails,
and compliance
● A risk data exchange where customers and partners contribute signals and benefit from
improved risk management
Why this horizon is hard: it forces choices about openness, governance, partner economics,
and channel conflict. Which leads to the key advisory principle:
Incumbents should not “announce a platform.” They should earn a platform by creating
compelling interactions and modular capabilities first.

Bridging to 3.2:
Even with a good transformation arc, incumbents fail because the organization’s structure and
incentives pull resources back to the core. Next we’ll look at an execution pattern that prevents
the core from suffocating the new model: incubate, separate, then integrate/morph.
Sub-Module 3.2 — How to Execute: Incubate → Separate → Integrate/Morph

Instructional content (learner-facing)
Once leaders accept disruption and platform threats, they often jump to a structural question:
“Where should the new initiative live?”
A common instinct is to place it directly inside the core business so it can “leverage scale.” That
seems efficient—but it is often fatal, because the core has gravitational pull. The core is
optimized to:
● Protect margins
● Serve demanding customers
● Avoid compliance and brand risks
● Allocate resources to predictable ROI
Early disruptive or platform moves don’t look good through those lenses. They often require:

● Learning cycles
● Experimentation with pricing and partner economics
● Narrow-scope launches to build local density
● Different risk tolerances and governance
That’s why a staged execution approach is useful:
Stage 1: Incubate (prove the value in a protected sandbox)
Incubation means creating a small team with autonomy to test a new model without being
constantly compared to the core.
In insurance, incubation is appropriate when:
● The initiative targets a new segment or a different value proposition (e.g., prevention
services)
● The unit economics are uncertain and require iteration
● Partner integration and governance need experimentation
What good incubation looks like:
● A narrow use case and clear hypotheses (e.g., reduce cycle time by X, reduce fraud
leakage by Y)
● A learning-oriented scorecard (adoption, completion rates, partner quality, customer
satisfaction)
● Clear guardrails for compliance and brand risk without importing the entire core
bureaucracy
Stage 2: Separate (protect the model from core incentives and channel conflict)
Separation becomes necessary when the new model begins to show traction but still clashes
with core economics or channels.
In insurance, separation may be needed because:
● The new model threatens existing distribution relationships (agents, brokers)
● The new model uses different pricing or underwriting logic
● The new model prioritizes growth and interaction density over short-term margin
Separation can take multiple forms:
● A distinct business unit with its own P&amp;L and metrics
● A subsidiary or joint venture
● A dedicated digital line with separate operating processes
The point is not “org chart elegance.” The point is avoiding a predictable failure mode: the core
starves the new model because it looks unattractive compared to mainstream priorities.
Common Pitfall:
Separating without a plan to reconnect. Separation can protect, but it can also create a forever-
island with no pathway to scale through the core’s assets.
Stage 3: Integrate/Morph (bring it back when the model is proven)
Integration (or morphing the core) is appropriate when:
● The new model’s economics and governance are stable

● There is a clear pathway to scale through the incumbent’s assets (brand, licenses,
capital, enterprise relationships)
● The organization is ready to adopt new processes without destroying them
In insurance, integration could mean:
● Embedding the new claims ecosystem approach into the mainstream claims
organization
● Rolling out modular APIs and partner governance across multiple lines
● Using outcome-based services as a standard retention and risk management capability
Key Insight:
The goal is not to “keep it separate forever.” The goal is to protect learning early and scale
later—without letting the core prematurely impose its constraints.

Bridging to 3.3:
Even with the right strategy and structure, incumbents hit a painful phase: investments rise,
results lag, and both markets and internal stakeholders lose patience. Next we’ll address the
“transformation trough” and how to help insurance leaders navigate it.
Sub-Module 3.3 — The Transformation Trough: Why Markets and Organizations Punish
the Transition

Instructional content (learner-facing)
A brutal reality of incumbent response is that the hardest part is not deciding what to do. It’s
surviving the period where doing the right thing looks like doing the wrong thing.
This period is the transformation trough:
● Costs increase (technology investment, new talent, partner enablement, governance)
● Complexity increases (running old and new models simultaneously)
● Benefits lag (network effects and outcome-based value take time)
● Internal friction rises (channel conflict, KPI conflict, culture friction)
Meanwhile, both external markets and internal leaders often continue to evaluate the firm as if it
is still a “classic incumbent”—rewarding stable margins and predictable execution.
Why the trough exists (and why it’s predictable)
Transformation introduces a temporary mismatch:
● You are investing like a growth company
● But you are still valued and managed like an incumbent optimized for current profits
In insurance, this mismatch is amplified because:
● Regulatory and capital constraints slow down speed of experimentation
● Trust risks make “move fast and break things” impossible
● Distribution relationships create political complexity
So the trough isn’t a failure signal by itself. It’s a predictable stage that must be managed.
How to advise leaders through the trough
As a Client Director, you can coach clients to manage the trough with four levers:
1) Explicitly communicate the transformation logic and milestones
Leaders need to articulate:
● Why the market shift requires this change (disruption/platform dynamics)
● What horizons they are pursuing (core productivity → outcomes → ecosystem
enablement)

● What milestones demonstrate progress before revenue dominance arrives
Milestones should be operational and leading indicators:
● Claims cycle time reductions
● Fraud leakage reduction
● Partner onboarding velocity with quality metrics
● Adoption and retention improvements in targeted segments
2) Separate scorecards: don’t evaluate Horizon 2/3 bets like Horizon 1
Use different metrics for different horizons:
● Horizon 1: cost, loss ratio, cycle time, reliability
● Horizon 2: customer outcomes, repeat interactions, service adoption, retention lift
● Horizon 3: ecosystem participation, match rates, multi-homing dynamics, partner quality
This reduces the risk of killing the future because it doesn’t match today’s P&amp;L expectations.
3) Manage cannibalization and channel conflict intentionally
If the new model threatens an existing channel or product line, conflict is inevitable.
Your advisory role is to push for explicit decisions:
● Which segments will move first?
● How will channel partners be compensated or repositioned?
● What governance prevents internal sabotage?
4) Build “credible commitment” to sustain investment through the dip
Transformation dies when leadership wavers. Credible commitment can include:
● Structural separation where needed (Sub-Module 3.2)
● Dedicated investment envelopes protected from quarterly firefighting
● Partnership strategies that reduce the cost of building everything alone
Key Insight:
The trough is not just financial—it’s cognitive. Stakeholders keep asking, “Is this working?”
before the model is mature. Leaders need a progress narrative grounded in leading indicators.
Common Pitfall:
Over-promising platform outcomes too early. If leaders promise “ecosystem scale” before
governance and local density are proven, credibility collapses in the trough.

Module Summary (~200 words)
Incumbent insurers can respond effectively to disruption and platform threats without panicking
into “platform theater.” A realistic path is a staged transformation arc: first extract value from the
installed base through measurable core productivity (modern, modular operations and decision
systems), then shift toward outcome-based services that reduce incidents and improve
recovery, and only then enable ecosystems that scale those outcomes through partners.
Execution matters as much as strategy: early-stage disruptive/platform bets often die when the
core applies its metrics and incentives too early. A practical approach is incubate to learn and
prove value in a protected scope, separate when KPI or channel conflict would starve the
model, and integrate/morph once the model is stable and ready to scale through the
incumbent’s assets. Finally, leaders must anticipate the transformation trough—where costs and
complexity rise before benefits fully appear and stakeholders still judge the firm through
incumbent expectations. The advisory playbook is to define clear milestones and leading
indicators, use separate scorecards by horizon, manage channel conflict explicitly, and sustain
credible commitment through the dip.
