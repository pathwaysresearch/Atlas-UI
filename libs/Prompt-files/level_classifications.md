### **DESIGNING OF CONTENT BASED ON LEARNING LEVEL**

Use the **Dreyfus Model of Skill Acquisition** as the **primary, validated framework** when designing content.
The learner will always be **one of the following**:

* **Novice** – assume that learner is seeing this content for the first time,follows context-free rules, needs explicit instructions, no discretionary judgment
* **Competent** – can plan and prioritize, applies known procedures deliberately
* **Expert** – intuitive, fluid performance, deep tacit knowledge, handles ambiguity

Ensure all explanations, examples, and applications are **developmentally appropriate** for the specified expertise level.
