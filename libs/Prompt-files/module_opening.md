(**3. Contextual Hook** *(2–3 sentences)*)

Purpose:
Connect the module to the learner’s **level, job role, industry, and real-world challenge**.

**Template (use exactly):**

> As a **[JOB_ROLE]** at **[COMPANY_NAME / INDUSTRY]**, you **[SPECIFIC_SITUATION_OR_CHALLENGE]**.
> This module gives you **[SPECIFIC_CAPABILITY]** to **[SOLVE_OR_IMPROVE_THAT_SITUATION]**.

(**4. Learning Objectives** *(3–4 bullets, measurable)*)

Start with:

> **By the end of this module, you will be able to:**

Bullet format:

* **[ACTION_VERB]** [SPECIFIC_OBJECT] using **[METHOD / FRAMEWORK]**
* **[ANALYZE / EVALUATE / DESIGN]** [DOMAIN_ELEMENT] with **[APPROACH / CRITERIA]**
* **[IDENTIFY / ASSESS]** when **[CONCEPT]** leads to **[OUTCOME A]** vs. **[OUTCOME B]**
* Apply these frameworks to **[SPECIFIC_WORK_CONTEXT]** at **[COMPANY_NAME / INDUSTRY]**

Rules:

* Use observable verbs (avoid *understand*, *learn*)
* Each bullet should map to a real workplace decision

(**6.1. Key Takeaways**)

Format as a numbered list *(5–7 items, each connecting concept to a specific example)*:

**Module [X] Key Takeaways:**

1. **[CONCEPT_NAME]**: [EXPLANATION_IN_OWN_WORDS]. In **[INDUSTRY]**,  
   **[SPECIFIC_EXAMPLE]** exemplifies **[CONCEPT]** (**[SPECIFIC_DETAIL]**).

2. **[CONCEPT_NAME]**: [EXPLANATION]. **[COMPANY/CASE]**’s **[OUTCOME]**  
   (**[SPECIFIC_NUMBER/METRIC]**) resulted from **[APPLICATION_OF_CONCEPT]**.

[Continue with remaining takeaways, each 2–3 sentences maximum]

**[EXAMPLE – Financial Services]:**

1. **Platform vs. Pipeline**: Platforms orchestrate external resources  
   and optimize for interaction; pipelines own resources and optimize  
   for efficiency. In financial services, **PolicyBazaar** exemplifies  
   a platform (connects insurers with buyers), while traditional insurers  
   exemplify a pipeline (own distribution).

2. **Network Effects Define Success**: Platforms succeed when adding  
   users on one side increases value for the other side. **UPI**’s dominance  
   (85%+ market share through PhonePe/Google Pay) resulted from strong  
   cross-side network effects between consumers and merchants.

(**6.2. Reflection Questions**)

3–4 questions that prompt application to the learner’s specific context:

**Before moving to the next module, consider:**

1. **Analyze Your Current [WORK_CONTEXT]**: [SPECIFIC_QUESTION_ABOUT_THEIR_WORK]  
   What **[SPECIFIC_EVIDENCE]** supports your conclusion?

2. **Identify [OPPORTUNITY_TYPE]**: [QUESTION_PROMPTING_APPLICATION]  
   Which **[ELEMENTS]** could they **[ACTION]**? What **[OUTCOME]** might result?

3. **Assess [RELEVANT_DIMENSION]**: Based on what you've learned about  
   **[CONCEPT]**, [QUESTION_ABOUT_READINESS/FEASIBILITY]? What **[CONSTRAINTS]** exist?

[Optional 4th question for advanced learners focusing on edge cases or strategic implications]

---

(**6.3. Preparation for Next Module**)

Brief preview with connection:

In **Module [X+1]**, we'll build on this foundation to explore **[NEXT_TOPIC]**.  
You'll learn **[SPECIFIC_CAPABILITY_1]**, how to **[SPECIFIC_CAPABILITY_2]**,  
and **[SPECIFIC_CAPABILITY_3]**—all using **[INDUSTRY]** examples. This knowledge  
is essential for **[SPECIFIC_APPLICATION_IN_THEIR_ROLE]**.
